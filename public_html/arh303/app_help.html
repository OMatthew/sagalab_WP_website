<p class="p2"><b>Q: </b>What if I navigated away from the Welcome screen without showing it to the front desk?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>A: </b></span>You can simply restart the app and it will produce the Welcome screen again if you are in range of the beacons at the entrance of the Blanton. If you are on an iOS device, double-tap the Home button and swipe up on the app to clear it - then restart the app. If you are on an Android device, tap the square icon on the Home Screen and swipe to clear the app - then restart it. The app will recognize the beacons again and show the Welcome screen.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Alternatively, you can speak to a museum staff member at the front desk and explain that you are an ARH 303 student and they should allow you to pass.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Q: </b>I lost phone service and I cannot connect to WiFi, so I am not able to log into Canvas and access the activity. What should I do?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>A: </b></span>Should you be unable to connect to wifi or otherwise have trouble with the app, please check in at the main ticketing desk with your UT ID and tell the visitor services staff that you need a hard copy of the week's assignment. The Blanton staff will hand you a printout of the assignment for you to complete. You must return this assignment to the ticketing desk when you leave the museum. It is your responsibility to contact your TA separately to ensure that you receive proper credit for your visit. You can also report the problem here: <a href="https://www.cognitoforms.com/TheUniversityOfTexasAtAustin1/BeaconTechIssuesReport"><span class="s2">https://www.cognitoforms.com/TheUniversityOfTexasAtAustin1/BeaconTechIssuesReport</span></a></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Q: </b>Where do I store my belongings while I am in the museum?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>A: </b></span>There is a separate area for backpacks and bags for students of this class. When you enter the Blanton lobby, continue down the hallway to the right as you enter the lobby, towards the Print Study Room. As you approach the Print Study Room, you will see a backpack cage with a Blanton staff member to your right. Show this staff member your app, hand him or her your bag, and you will receive a number tag. Keep this number with you for the duration of your stay and return it when you depart to receive your bag.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Q: </b></span>I'm in the Blanton during my section time, but the app is still locked. What should I do?</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4"><b>A: </b></span>There are a couple settings that - if not active - could prevent the app from unlocking.</p>
<p class="p6">First, make sure that your Bluetooth is turned on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">On iOS devices (iPhones, iPods, and iPads), go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Bluetooth. Tap the On/Off button to activate Bluetooth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">On Android devices, go to Settings &gt; Bluetooth. Tap the slider to turn on Bluetooth.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6">If this did not work, make sure that you have given the app the appropriate permissions. It needs to have access to your location to work properly. When you installed the app, your device will have asked for these permissions, so if you did not accept them you may need to change the setting.</p>
<p class="p6">On iOS devices, open the Menu in the ARH 303 app, then tap on "Settings." This will show you your user profile - and at the bottom, you'll see the permissions you have given the app. If the Location permission is toggled off, tap the slider. This will take you to the app settings page. Once there, tap on Location and change the setting to "Always."</p>
<p class="p6">On Android devices, open the Menu in the ARH 303 app, then tap "Settings." This will take you to the "App info" page for ARH 303. Select "Permissions" from the list and tap the slider to enable Location.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p3">If you're still locked out of the app then please try walking into another gallery. You may need to be get within proximity of a beacon and wait for a few seconds before seeing the Welcome screen again.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s5">If none of the above worked, please go here: <a href="https://www.cognitoforms.com/TheUniversityOfTexasAtAustin1/BeaconTechIssuesReport"><span class="s2">https://www.cognitoforms.com/TheUniversityOfTexasAtAustin1/BeaconTechIssuesReport</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Q: </b>What are beacons?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>A: </b></span>Beacons are devices that use Bluetooth technology to broadcast small packets of information that your mobile device can read. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes and increasingly used to help people interact with digital content in a physical environment. This app uses beacons to help facilitate the delivery of location-sensitive content, specifically assigned art objects and the questions related to them.</p>
