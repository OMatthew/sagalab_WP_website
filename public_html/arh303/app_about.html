<h2>About this App</h2>

<div style="font-size: 1.1em;font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">
  Beacons are devices that broadcast small packets of information that your
  mobile device can read. They use a technology called Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE),
  otherwise known as "Bluetooth Smart." Unlike other Bluetooth devices, such as
  headsets or speakers, BLE beacons do not have to be paired with your mobile
  device; they simply transmit data that any eligible device can receive and
  interpret. This makes beacons ideal for connecting digital content to physical
  environments.
<br/><br/>
  Mobile apps can be configured to listen for beacon signals and trigger
  predetermined actions based on the information they receive. For example,
  an app can load specific content - text notifications, images, maps, and
  so on - when it "sees" a particular beacon. Different beacons can trigger
  different behaviors, depending on the need.
<br/><br/>
  The ARH 303 app uses beacons to detect your presence in the Blanton Museum
  of Art and record a grade in Canvas. Beacon interaction will also prompt
  the app to load the list of objects and questions for the week.</div>
